These are the R files for the YES-SETAC course
‘Marine environmental data: principles of good data management and access to open data resources’

Part of the course will teach you how to get and visualize data in R.
For this part, please bring along a laptop with R and Rstudio installed:

* Download and install R from http://cran.r-project.org 
*	Download and install Rstudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
*	Install packages:
    *	‘ggplot2’, ‘sf’, ‘raster’, ‘sdmpredictors’, ‘dplyr’, ‘data.table’, ‘mapview’, ‘leaflet’
    *	You should be able to this by following line of code:
    
    `install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'sf', 'raster', 'sdmpredictors', 'dplyr', 'data.table', 'mapview', 'leaflet'))`

If you don’t have any R experience, please follow a basic introduction, for example:

* The DataCamp free introduction to R: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r
*	Harvard intro to R: http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/Rintro.html
